🌿 Crop Disease Detection using CNN
🧩 Project Overview

This project focuses on detecting plant leaf diseases using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) — a deep learning technique well-suited for image classification.
The goal is to classify leaf images of Tomato, Potato, and Pepper Bell plants into healthy or diseased categories, enabling early diagnosis and promoting sustainable agriculture practices.

🎯 Objective

To build an intelligent image classification model that accurately identifies different crop diseases from leaf images, helping farmers take timely preventive actions and reduce excessive pesticide use.

🧠 Technical Summary

Domain: Image Classification

Theme: Sustainability in Agriculture

Algorithm: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

Dataset: PlantVillage Dataset (16 classes across 3 plant species)

Frameworks: TensorFlow / Keras

Languages: Python

📁 Dataset Details

The dataset contains images of:

Tomato: Bacterial Spot, Mosaic Virus, Early Blight, Late Blight, Leaf Mold, etc.

Potato: Early Blight, Late Blight, Healthy

Pepper Bell: Bacterial Spot, Healthy

Each class contains hundreds to thousands of labeled leaf images, divided into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
